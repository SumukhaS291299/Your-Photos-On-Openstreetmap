This is not a binary generated from my code....
And I take no credit for the exiftool.exe in the same directory


However, I think this tool is one of the best tools to extract metadata from photos/videos

In the future, I'll be providing more customization, to extract with different keys fields.

For now however, I'll only support exif tool

The usage is

exiftool.exe -json <folder-path-containing-files>
